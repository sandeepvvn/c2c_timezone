## Usage

 1.**To convert a date by using a div tag**
    
   Return the date in the following format :
     `<div data-ctoc   data-ctoc-time="" data-ctoc-req-zone="" data-ctoc-req-format=""</div>`
   Here data-ctoc is the identifier for tag, which gets removed once the date is converted.
   
   The time to be converted should be given JS date string  format  in the data-ctoc-time field [View Date String formats](https://pages.github.com/).
   
   data-ctoc-format is supplement which returns date required in a specified format which you desire.There are a range format it supports.[View Formats](https://pages.github.com/)
   
     "<div data-ctoc-timezone=\"server\" data-ctoc-time=\""+time_string+"\" data-ctoc-req-zone=\""+req_zone+"\" data-ctoc-req-format=\""+req_format+"\"></div>"
    
    
   The Date is returned in a string of desired format.
   
 2.**To convert any date object in JS on client side** Include a div tag in the html code in following format 
    
   `<div data-ctoc-timezone="" data-ctoc-time="" data-ctoc-req-zone="" data-ctoc-req-format=""</div>`
    Example:
    `<div data-ctoc-timezone="server" data-ctoc-time="Feb 28 2013 19:00:00 EST" data-ctoc-req-zone="IST" data-ctoc-req-format="Do M YYYY        hh:mm:ss a"</div>`
    The above example converts your EST time to IST, and return the date in string.
    
                                                            or
   Call the the `convertTime` function in js.
        `CtoCTimezone.convertTime(dateobject,"Required time zone");`
   Example:
          `CtoCTimezone.convertTime(new Date(),"America/New_York")`;
